    <h1>Param Trivedi</h1>
    <header>About Me</header>
    <p>Hey, how you doing? My name is Param Trivedi and I'm from India studying as a international student in Algonquin Collage. 
        Still I haven't landed in Ottawa but I'll move as soon as my visa comes. Also I'm really exicted to land in Canada as soon 
        as possible, that's beginning a new life for me. Ofcourse that won't be easy but definately many things to learn. Apart from that
        I want to tell you bit about myself, right now I work as Freelance Graphic Designer and Web Developer. Since last 4 or 5 years
        I've been working into this area and right now I work with different clients. For me design is very important part of my life it 
        teaches new things to me not just about my work but also about life and which I really like about it. 
    </p>

    <p>In my free time or you can say in my everyday life I never miss to play Football, that is a sport which is really near to my heart. I do 
        follow English Football League which is Premire League. Also, Formula 1 racing is something which I'm getting really mad about from recent pandemic times.
        Right now the reason why I came back to collage is I felt that it's time to learn more sharpen my skills and take a break from my daily working life and enjoy outside world. That's it from my side, hope you like it. Cheers!
